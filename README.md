A palindrome is a **word** or **sentence** that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

`Examples :`

*   A man, a plan, a canal. Panama

The programme should return ```true``` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, ```false```.

## Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

![ROT13](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FROT13&psig=AOvVaw0yi3U_Wr3dpmYjExzLyDY9&ust=1632859207810000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCMDYrdr4n_MCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

The function takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. All letters as inputs are uppercase.
